Since it's such an important visual aspect of the page, I felt like it needed description even though no new information is conveyed.

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

Many brand icons are displayed in cartoon-esqe thought or speech bubbles, implying that the people at the table are working with these technologies."/>
            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

        <!-- Are the icons here  based off standard icons, which would presumably have a standardized alt text? I know that screen readers have emoji functionality. Google isn't giving me a quick answer to this, sadly. -->

            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
